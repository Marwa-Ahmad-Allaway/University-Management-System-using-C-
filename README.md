# University-Management-System-using-C-
This project is a complete University Management System developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It simulates and manages key university entities such as Students, Professors, Teaching Assistants (TAs), and Courses.

#✅ Main Features:
Student Management:

Add new students.

Enroll students in courses, considering prerequisites and maximum allowed credit hours based on GPA.

Data Persistence:
All data is stored in CSV files and is automatically loaded at program startup and saved upon exit to ensure continuity between sessions.

⚙️ Technologies Used:
C++ programming language

Object-Oriented Programming (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)

CSV file handling (read/write)

STL containers like vector, string, fstream
